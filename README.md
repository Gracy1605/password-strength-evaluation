# Password Strength Evaluation

## Overview
This repository contains the report and analysis for **Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength**. The objective of the task is to understand what makes a password strong, test password strength using an online tool, and summarize best practices for password security.

## Contents
- Password samples with varying complexity
- Evaluation using an online password strength checker
- Analysis of results and feedback
- Best practices for creating strong passwords
- Summary of common password attacks
- Final report document

## Purpose
To learn how password complexity affects security and how to defend against common password-based attacks.

## Key Learnings
- Longer passwords with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols are significantly stronger.
- Unique passwords for each account reduce risk from credential stuffing.
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) greatly enhances account security.
- Awareness of phishing, keylogging, and social engineering is essential.

## Conclusion
Password complexity increases the time and resources required for attackers to crack a password. Longer, mixed-character passwords reduce vulnerability to brute force and dictionary attacks. Strong, unique passwords combined with good cyber hygiene and additional security measures like MFA are essential for protecting digital accounts and preventing breaches.
